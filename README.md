#global terrorism data
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes crucial data on local  as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
This dataset indicates about the types of  different terrorism activities, the region where it is carried , the specified year,
its succesion or failure, attacking region .
It includes the data of nearly 180 countries 
Initially the dataset consisted of 181691 rows and 135 columns , we performed data cleaning on this and reduced the width to 48 rows . This was done to remove unnecessary data from the dataset .
We plotted a bar graph of country versus attacks with country on x axis and attacks on y axis.
After performing the EDA on GTD we came to know about that after the year 2004 there is a sudden increase in terrorism activities . Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India are the  Asian countries which were most prone to terrorist attacks .
The less affected countries includes Egypt , France and Algeria.
Suicide bombing saw a substantial increase post 2004.
